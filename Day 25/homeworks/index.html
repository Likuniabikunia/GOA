    <p> That morning, 19 terrorists hijacked four commercial airliners scheduled to travel 
        from the East Coast to California. <br>  The hijackers crashed the first two planes into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center 
        in New York City,
        two of the world's five tallest buildings at the time,
        and aimed the next two flights toward targets in or near Washington, D.C. <br>  The September 11 attacks killed 2,977 people, 
        making them the deadliest terrorist attack in history, and instigated the multi-decade global war on terror, 
        fought in Afghanistan, Iraq, and elsewhere.</p>

        <h1 align="left">Osama bin Laden</h1>
        <p>Osama was born in Riyadh to the aristocratic bin Laden family. He studied at local universities until 1979, 
         <br> when he joined the Afghan mujahidin against the Soviet Union in the wake of the Afghan–Soviet War.
         He was considered a war hero due to his role in successfully opposing the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan and 
         offered an articulate voice and organizational structure to many across the region harboring grievances against Western imperialism, 
         often having approval ratings in some countries higher than those of national leaders. Nonetheless, 
         his justification and orchestration of attacks against civilian targets in the United States, 
         including the September 11 attacks, have made him a hated figure in the West, 
         where public opinion largely views Bin Laden as a figurehead of mass murder.</p>
